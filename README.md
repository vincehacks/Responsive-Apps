#### HTML Basics
1. header
    - could contain elements like a log and a nav bar.  Perhaps the title of the page too?

1. footer

    - could contain disclaimers, copyrights, and less important links (privacy, terms and conditions, legal, etc).

1. main

    - the bulk of your site goes in here

1. section

    - within some of the tags listed above, there can be different sections.  Use this tag to block each section off

1. nav

    - this will hold navigation links

1. article

    - if you're writing a blog, or have a page with many self contained sections, this might work well

1. aside

    - this is for tangential material.  Sidebars, inserts, etc.
